# Positive Unlabeled data simulation


To validate the metastasis predictive genes selected by PLUS on TCGA pan-cancer data, we collected scRNA-seq data sets collected from human cancer tissues. We first conducted cell clustering analysis on each data by using (1) general genes with high expression dispersion and (2) the 294 metastasis predictive genes identified by PLUS.

Cell clusters of the cancer cells different metastatic status made by using all genes and the PLUS selected metastasis predictive genes in the scRNA-seq data.
